    Inheritance provides a method for creating new classes from existing classes
    The new class contains data and behavior of existing class
    Allows for reuse of existing class
    Allows new classes to modify behaviors of existing classes to make it unique without actually modifying the original class

    Related classes: savings account, checking account
                    Person, Employee, student, Faculty, Staff

    Ex: Account
            balance, deposit, withdraw
        Savings account
            balance, deposit, withdraw, interest rate, ..
        Checking account
            balance, deposit, withdraw, minimum balance, per check fee
        Trust Account
            balance, deposit, withdraw, interest rate

        We can see that these types of accounts are very different but they have some common attrubutes and behaviors

        Without inheritance, if you implement the above , you would see code duplication all over
